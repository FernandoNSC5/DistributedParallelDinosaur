This simple college software was developed in order to exemplify Parallel Processing and Distributed Processing.

Distributed Parallel Dinosaur has a simple UI able to handle a list of numbers as string (1 2 3 4 5 ...), stripe it into sub-lists and send to many servers as you want in order to find the higher or minimum value of the list.
